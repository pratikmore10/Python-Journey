# Python Journey
> My python learning journey with coursera specialization "Python for Everybody"

## Learning
[Introduction to Python](doc/introduction_to_python.md)

## Assignments
1. [Pay Calculator](/src/assignments/pay_calculator.py)<br>
My very first basic program to calculate the ***Pay*** of the employee on the basis of the ***Hours*** they worked where ***Rate*** increases 1.5 time if they have worked for more than 40 hrs.

1. [Pay Calculator Using Function](/src/assignments/pay_calculator_function.py)<br>
Same problem solved using ***FUNCTIONS***.  

1. [Iterate And Maintain MAX & MIN](/src/assignments/loop_counting.py)<br>
Program that keeps on asking user for an input till the user returns 'done' as an input.<br>
It stores all the input in a list and then returns ***MAX & MIN*** of the given list. 

1. [File Reading](/src/assignments/file_reading.py)<br>
A program that prompts for a file name, then opens that file and reads through the file, and print the contents of the file.

1. [Count of Specific Lines](/src/assignments/count_word.py)<br>
A program that prompts for a file name, then opens that file and reads through the file, looking for lines  of the form: **X-DSPAM-Confidence:    0.8475** and count these lines and extract the floating point values from each of the lines and compute the average of those values and produce an output.<br>
**NOTE:** The path of the file for input should be same as the path of your project file.

1. [Words List](/src/assignments/words_list.py)<br>
This program builds a list of words from the input provided. For each word on each line the program checks to see if the word is already in the list and if not append it to the list and then sorts the list of words and print the resulting words in alphabetical order.<br>
**NOTE:** The path of the file for input should be same as the path of your project file.
