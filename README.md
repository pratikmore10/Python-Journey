# Python Journey
> My python learning journey with coursera specialization "Python for Everybody"

## Learning
[Introduction to Python](doc/introduction_to_python.md)

## Assignments
1. [Pay Calculator](/src/assignments/pay_calculator.py)<br>
My very first basic program to calculate the ***Pay*** of the employee on the basis of the ***Hours*** they worked where ***Rate*** increases 1.5 time if they have worked for more than 40 hrs.

1. [Pay Calculator Using Function](/src/assignments/pay_calculator_function.py)<br>
Same problem solved using ***FUNCTIONS***.  

1. [Iterate And Maintain MAX & MIN](/src/assignments/loop_counting.py)<br>
Program that keeps on asking user for an input till the user returns 'done' as an input.<br>
It stores all the input in a list and then returns ***MAX & MIN*** of the given list. 

1. [File Reading](/src/assignments/file_reading.py)<br>
A program that prompts for a file name, then opens that file and reads through the file, and print the contents of the file.

1. [Count of Specific Lines](/src/assignments/count_word.py)<br>
A program that prompts for a file name, then opens that file and reads through the file, looking for lines  of the form: **X-DSPAM-Confidence:    0.8475** and count these lines and extract the floating point values from each of the lines and compute the average of those values and produce an output.
