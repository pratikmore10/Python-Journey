# Python Journey
> My python learning journey with coursera specialization "Python for Everybody"

## Learning
[Introduction to Python](doc/introduction_to_python.md)

## Assignments
1. [Pay Calculator](/src/assignments/pay_calculator.py)<br>
My very first basic program to calculate the ***Pay*** of the employee on the basis of the ***Hours*** they worked where ***Rate*** increases 1.5 time if they have worked for more than 40 hrs.

1. [Pay Calculator Using Function](/src/assignments/pay_calculator_function.py)<br>
Same problem solved using ***FUNCTIONS***.  

1. [Iterate and maintain MAX & MIN](/src/assignments/loop_counting.py)<br>
Program that keeps on asking user for an input till the user returns 'done' as an input.<br>
It stores all the input in a list and then returns ***MAX & MIN*** of the given list.
